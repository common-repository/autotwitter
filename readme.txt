Auto Twitter lets you automatically tweet blog posts to your twitter account. Quick, simple, easy to setup and use.

== Description ==

Auto Twitter is a wordpress plugin that automatically tweets each new blog post to the twitter account you specify. There really isn't anything more to it than that. You enter your twitter account login and password (locally stored), and every time you publish a new post, the title of your blog post will be posted (with a link of course) to your twitter account. 

We will be adding some bells and whistles to this down the road, including the ability to post to multiple twitter accounts at once.

== Installation ==

1. Upload all files  to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Authorize your twitter account in 'Auto Twitter Settings'
That's it!
